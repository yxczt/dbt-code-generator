Remember that the reasons of making mart tables are:
The most important aspect of marts is that they contain all of the useful data about a particular entity at a granular level. That doesn’t mean we don’t bring in lots of other entities and concepts, like tons of user data into our orders mart, we do! It just means that individual orders remain the core grain of our table. If we start grouping users and orders along a date spine, into something like user_orders_per_day, we’re moving past marts into metrics.
Group by department or area of concern: If you have fewer than 10 or so marts you may not have much need for subfolders, so as with the intermediate layer, don’t over-optimize too early. If you do find yourself needing to insert more structure and grouping though, use useful business concepts here. In our marts layer, we’re no longer worried about source-conformed data, so grouping by departments (marketing, finance, etc.) is the most common structure at this stage.
Name by entity: Use plain English to name the file based on the concept that forms the grain of the mart customers, orders. Note that for pure marts, there should not be a time dimension (orders_per_day) here, that is typically best captured via metrics.
